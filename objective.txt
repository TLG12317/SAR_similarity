rewrite python code

Send the code already written


evaluate 
eigenvalues divided by total number
plot on a graph

see how reducing rank affects the NCC



take subset of A
make new X
leftover points match to the new "50x50" matrix X
minimize squared error
ensure it is still normed
compare with original optimization


original 64 x 64
map to new X with rank constraint
X becomes 64 x 5

take subset (maybe 50x50)
map another X
X becomes 50 x 5


Using some vector part of the 14, we "compare" with the 50 to see how different it is from the original (vector norm)
